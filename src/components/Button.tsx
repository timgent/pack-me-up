 * A variant is a claim about importance, so a screen showing four filled
 * buttons is claiming four things are the most important thing on it — which
 * is how the packing list came to open with a row of orange pills above the
 * list they were less important than. The tiers, loudest first:
 *
 * - `primary`   — the one action the screen exists for
 * - `secondary` — the one that is nearly it
 * - `danger`    — the one that cannot be undone
 * - `subtle`    — everything occasional: a neutral box, still plainly a button
 * - `ghost`     — the same quiet tier, with no box at all
 *
 * `subtle` exists because `ghost` is primary-tinted: a row of ghost buttons
 * still reads teal, and a row of *occasional* actions should read as nothing
 * in particular.
