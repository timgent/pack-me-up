/**
 * The same Application Capability description served via content negotiation at
 * "/" (src/capability/document.ts, src/capability/negotiate.ts, /middleware.ts),
 * restated as RDFa attributes in the footer so a plain browser GET of the SPA's
 * HTML carries the triples too, with no Accept header gymnastics required
 * (https://dokieli.github.io/application-capability/).
 *
 * It is built from the same `capabilityDescription()` call that produces the
 * negotiated document, so the two cannot drift: there is only one description,
 * in two syntaxes. The origin comes from the browser, so a preview deployment
 * describes itself, exactly as the negotiated document does.
 *
 * Literal values use `<span property=… content=…/>` rather than `<meta>`:
 * React 19 auto-hoists `<meta>` into `<head>` wherever it's rendered, which
 * would pull it out from under its `typeof` ancestor and break the subject it's
 * meant to describe. `content` is a general RDFa attribute, not `<meta>`-
 * specific, so the empty `<span>` carries the same triple without being
 * hoisted. Every element here is otherwise empty, so this adds no visible
 * footprint to the footer. SHACL shapes aren't restated: ac:shape just points
 * at their fragment on the negotiated JSON-LD/Turtle document, which stays the
 * one place they're defined.
