/**
 * What the app says while it is signed in but cannot reach the Pod.
 *
 * The failure mode this exists for (#342) is not a broken app — everything on
 * screen is the device's own copy and stays editable — it is a user who cannot
 * tell "no signal" from "signed out" and re-authenticates, or worse, assumes
 * their lists are gone. So the banner answers both questions at once: why the
 * Pod is quiet, and what happens to the changes they make in the meantime.
 *
 * Deliberately not dismissible and deliberately not an error: it clears itself
 * the moment the session comes back, which on a passing signal drop is seconds.
 * The alarming banner is `SessionExpiredBanner`, and that one is reserved for a
 * session the provider has actually ended.
