/**
 * What the device remembers about the signed-in user *between* live sessions.
 *
 * A Solid session only becomes live once the provider has answered a refresh —
 * which needs the network. With no network there is nothing to answer with, so
 * everything the app knows about who is signed in would be gone until the
 * connection came back: the nav would offer "Sync & Share", and the pod-scoped
 * PouchDB namespace (which is derived from the pod URL, fetched from the WebID
 * profile) could not be worked out at all, so the user's own lists would not
 * even be on screen. That is #342 — offline looked exactly like signed out.
 *
 * So two facts are kept here, in localStorage, from the last live session:
 * the WebID, and the PouchDB namespace that identity's data lives in. Neither
 * is a credential — the refresh token stays in IndexedDB, owned by the auth
 * library — and both are cleared the moment the session genuinely ends, so a
 * signed-out device remembers nothing.
