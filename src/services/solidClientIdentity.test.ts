/**
 * Which client the app presents itself as decides how long a session survives.
 *
 * A hosted Client ID Document is a permanent identity: the provider re-reads it
 * on every grant, and the registration cannot go stale. A dynamic registration
 * is a throwaway one, created at login and kept only for as long as the provider
 * feels like keeping it — when it is reaped, the next refresh comes back
 * `invalid_client`, which is terminal, and the user is signed out with a
 * perfectly good refresh token on disk.
 *
 * The native shell is served from `https://localhost`, so it used to fall
 * through to dynamic registration on every install. These pin it to the hosted
 * document instead.
