 * signed-in user's card costs nothing when a packing list has already drawn
 * them, and the app reads any one card once however many components want it.
 *
 * No abort on unmount, for the same reason: the request belongs to the cache,
 * not to this component, and cancelling it would take it away from whoever else
 * is waiting. Unmounting only stops us writing state.
