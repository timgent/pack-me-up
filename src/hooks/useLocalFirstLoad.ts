 * Reads local data straight away and lets the pod catch up afterwards.

 * Everything this app shows is stored on the device as well as in the pod, so
 * there is nearly always something to render immediately: the PouchDB read
 * resolves in milliseconds. The pod → local sync that runs at login walks the
 * whole pod — the question set, every packing list, the tombstones — and takes
 * as long as the pod takes to answer, which on a slow connection is seconds.
 * Blocking the first paint on it turns opening a list the device already holds
 * into a wait for data the page isn't going to use.
 *
 * So `read` runs on mount, and again when the login sync finishes in case it
 * brought something this device had never seen. A page whose data is already on
 * screen by then, and that reconciles pod changes some other way — a
 * per-resource `usePodSync` poll, say — should skip that second read itself
 * rather than overwrite what the user is looking at.
 *
 * `read` is always called through its latest closure, so it does not need to be
 * memoized and does not belong in `deps`. Put in `deps` only what changes *which
 * data to read* — the database, a list id — the way you would for `useEffect`.
